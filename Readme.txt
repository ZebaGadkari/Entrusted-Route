The intended goal of the project Entrusted
Route was to help the owners of the goods
vehicles to keep track of the driver’s
expenditure that they appoint. The proposed
system comprises of an e-card that is handed
over to the drivers of goods vehicle. The driver
can use this card in any organization such as
petrol pumps, restaurants or service stations
where the owner has tied up.
Through this card the vehicle drivers can pay
their bills under the supervision of the owner
i.e. the driver has to present this card
wherever he has to pay the bills. The card will
then be scanned by the organization and the
amount charged for the driver’s expenditure
will be deducted from the
drivers account. Once the money gets
deducted a message will be sent to the owner.
